## 📌 Project Overview

The objective was to evaluate the 2024 sales performance of four regional sales representatives across a 12-month period, identify performance gaps, uncover seasonal patterns, and provide actionable business recommendations.

The analysis supports data-driven decision-making, improved forecasting, and optimized territory management.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

1. Compare annual and monthly sales targets against actual sales
2. Calculate variance (₦) and variance percentage (%)
3. Identify best-performing months per salesperson
4. Determine overall top performer
5. Analyze sales trends and performance consistency
6. Evaluate territory dynamics using economic indicators
7. Provide strategic recommendations for performance improvement

**Insights**

- March and December emerged as peak sales months.
- February recorded the worst overall performance (-31.49%).
- Sales followed a clear bi-monthly fluctuation pattern.
- Q1 and Q3 showed weak performance, while Q2 and Q4 were stronger.

| Q2      | -0.53%     |
| Q3      | -1.49%     |
| Q4      | +15.15%    |

Q4 significantly drove overall annual overperformance.


**🌍 Territory Analysis**

To understand performance differences, regional population and GDP per capita (PPP) were analyzed.

| Territory | Population (M) | GDP per Capita (PPP) | Variance % |
|-----------|---------------:|---------------------:|-----------:|
| Lagos     | 15.77          | ~17,282              | +5.47%     |
| Abuja     | 6.45           | ~5,288               | -0.37%     |
| Enugu     | 5.24           | ~3,504               | +1.51%     |
| PH        | 4.26           | ~2,401               | +0.27%     |

**Observations**

- Lagos’ strong economic power aligns with Chioma’s top performance.

- Ogun shows untapped potential given its relative economic strength.

- Kwara operates in a more constrained economic environment.

- Performance gaps are influenced by both regional economics and execution strategy.

## 📊 Analysis Approach
1. Monthly Variance Analysis
   - Calculated:
```
Variance = Actual Sales – Target Sales
Variance % = (Variance / Target) × 100 
```
2. Best Month Identification: Identified highest positive variance per salesperson.
3. Variance Percentage Evaluation: Used variance % to normalize performance comparison across territories.
4. Trend & Consistency Analysis:
   - Monthly trend analysis
   - Quarter-level aggregation
   - Volatility detection
   - Performance fluctuation patterns
5. Territory Dynamics: Integrated macroeconomic indicators (Population & GDP PPP) into performance interpretation.


## 🛠 Tools Used

- Microsoft Power BI (Data preprocessing & Tranformation)
- Variance Modeling Techniques
- Trend Analysis & Forecasting Logic

## 📌 Key Insights

- Performance volatility is systemic rather than purely individual.
- Strong seasonal influence (March & December spikes).
- Early-year underperformance needs strategic correction.
- High performers operate within strong economic zones but also demonstrate strategic execution.
- Static annual targets reduce forecasting accuracy.

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendations
1. Personalize Target Setting: Move from static targets to territory-adjusted and performance-based models.
2. Implement Seasonality-Based Planning: Align product launches and campaigns with historically strong months.
3. Leverage Top Performer Strategies: Document and replicate Chioma’s approach across regions.
4. Strengthen Q1 Strategy: Introduce targeted early-year promotions to counter historical dips.
5. Adopt Rolling Forecast Models: Shift from annual static targets to quarterly dynamic adjustments.
6. Improve Operational Readiness: Ensure inventory and logistics preparedness for peak months.

## 📈 Expected Business Impact
- Smoother revenue flow
- Reduced early-year sales dips
- Increased forecasting accuracy
- Improved accountability
- Stronger territory optimization
- Better resource allocation

## 📌 Conclusion

The company exceeded its annual sales target, but hidden volatility and regional disparities reveal deeper structural inefficiencies.

Sustainable growth requires:
- Data-informed target personalization
- Seasonality alignment
- Strategic territory investment
- Dynamic forecasting models

This project demonstrates how analytical insights can translate directly into strategic business advantage.
